	<h3>Cosmin Didii - 2012</h3>
	<p>RSoC was a great experience. It helped me understand a lot of concepts that I couldn't even conceive before and
	how the work on a project is in reality. You learn a lot of things in college, but working on a real project isn't
	one of them. You'll have to be very tidy and change the way you think. You're now working on something that people
	will use and you have to make it as best as you can. The sooner you understand that, the better.  If time would go
	back and I would have this summer again, I would apply to RSoC again.</p>

	<h3>Tudor Cornea - 2011</h3>
	<p>I participated in the RSoC 2011 programme within the Redmine Plugins project. At the time of my application, I was already up to date
	with some of ROSEdu’s projects (the Hammerfall graphical engine and WoUSO are just two examples off the top of my mind), and I considered
	it an opportunity to try my luck with the RSoC.</p>
	<p>Even though I had never previously used Redmine prior to my application and I had never written as much as a single line of code in Ruby
	(the language Redmine is written in), in the end I managed to write two fully functional plugins, which were later included in the Redmine
	Plugin Directory.</p>
	<p>I believe the most important thing within an Internship is the ability to work with new technologies and to interact with other developers
	through the code you use/improve. I also found the contact with the Open Source world to be especially interesting. Following the publication
	of our plugins we received feedback and bug reports from the community, which greatly helped me improve the code.</p>
	<p>The RSoC experience was an interesting one and I warmly recommend it to all those who are interested in finding out how an Open Source project
	is developed.</p>

	<h3>Alina Vlăduțu - 2011</h3>
	<p>To me, participating in the ROSEdu Summer of Code was an especially rewarding experience: I worked on the MedSoft project, starting from a
	personal idea next to a wonderful team that I got along with perfectly (in part because we had previously known each other). We learned many
	things, both on our own as well as from our team mates.</p>
	<p>What I especially liked about this programme is that it gave us the chance to organize ourselves and it has been proved that we assigned
	tasks very efficiently. I believe that RSoC is very suited for all those who wish to look back on their summer with pride and say that they
	haven’t lost their hand at writing code.</p>

	<h3>Codrin Ciubotariu - 2011</h3>
	<p>RSoC offers you a great way to apply and extend your IT knowledge. If you want to be part of a team with the same interests as you
	have and learn from experienced software engineers, this is the place you are looking for.</p>

	<h3>Valentin Goșu - 2010</h3>
	<p>ROSEdu Summer of Code was a great opportunity to work on an interesting project. An amazing experience; I worked with the best and the
	outcomes followed through. One of the best ways to spend a summer.</p>

	<h3>Emma Mirică - 2010</h3>
	<p>I remember it was a pleasant experience. I worked with other fellow students from my faculty, both from my year and younger, and I can
	safely say that I was taken away with the students’ interest in extracurricular projects.</p>
	<p>To me, this was one of the first projects I developed within a team, outside the faculty, and it has remained a milestone for my future
	projects to compare to.</p>

	<h3>Grigore Lupescu - 2009</h3>
	<p>Working on something you like, with a flexible schedule and next to other students with the same interests - this is how I’d describe RSoC.
	What I probably like most was that there was no pressure to “get the job done”, rather I had the time to explore alternatives and to try new
	approaches - in a word, to learn.</p>

	<h3>Lucian Mogoșanu - 2009</h3>
	<p>Xpresso/LCDME was to me an introduction to thinking and designing a real project from scratch. Within the project I used on one hand
	technologies that I was familiar with, such as Inkscape for part of the graphical design, SVN for versioning, and the base GNU/Linux tools,
	but on the other hand I had the opportunity to improve and refine my Haskell skills (expression parsing, working with monads, etc.), GTK and
	XML/SVG and take part in implementing algorithms such as Quine-McCluskey in the functional programming paradigm. Weak points: I believe the
	coding style and testing of the Haskell modules could have been further improved. The software application is still a long way off till
	it reaches maturity, for which reason I believe developing it will continue to be at least as fun as it has been so far.</p>

	<h3>Irina Grădinaru - 2009</h3>
	<p>Participating in the RSoC programme was an interesting experience for me in the fields of Open Source development and functional
	programming (the Haskell language).</p>
	<p>I acquired the special way of thinking pertaining to this paradigm, of conceiving code in the f(input) = output format with inputs
	and outputs picked so that they integrate seamlessly with the code from the rest of our team. At the same time I understood the importance
	of planning ahead in a software project, of developing a frame with the basic functionalities which would later be extended, and of using
	open formats to enable integration with other applications.</p>
	<p>Within the project I worked on, collaboration was mostly carried out on-site and not by means of mailing lists or IRC. This enabled us
	to witness live what other team members were doing and to learn from their successes and mistakes. The atmosphere in the EG106 lab was a
	relaxing one. There was no time pressure to be felt and you could think, carry out research and ask for advice at your own pace before
	writing a function - a workflow typical of Haskell programming :D.</p>
	<p>The RSoC initiative promises to grow in order to cover for both the software requirements as well as the professional expertise necessary
	to the students in the Computer Science department and beyond.</p>
